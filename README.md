# Car Brand Prediction Project

This project aims to predict the brand of a car based on certain features using machine learning techniques. It is built using Django, a high-level Python web framework, for the backend and potentially other libraries for machine learning models.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- **CarBrandPrediction/**: The main project directory.
  - **car_classifier/**: The Django app containing the car brand prediction functionality.
    - **migrations/**: Django database migrations.
    - **static/**: Static files such as CSS, JavaScript, etc.
    - **templates/**: HTML templates.
    - **admin.py**: Configuration for Django admin interface.
    - **apps.py**: Configuration for the app.
    - **models.py**: Defines database models.
    - **urls.py**: URL configuration for the app.

- **Dockerfile**: Dockerfile for containerization of the application.
- **docker-compose.yml**: Docker Compose file for managing the application's services.
- **predict.py**: Module for predicting car brands.
- **test.py**: Test file for testing models and functionality.
- **README.md**: Overview of the project and its structure.

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Create a virtual environment and activate it.
3. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Run migrations to create necessary database tables: `python manage.py migrate`.
5. Start the development server: `python manage.py runserver`.

## Usage

Once the development server is running, you can access the application by navigating to `http://localhost:8000` in your web browser. You should see the home page of the application.

## Docker
